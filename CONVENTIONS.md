- always use snake_case names for variables and function names, even in typescript and javascript
- Use Early Exit and Return Early coding styles in functions. 
- Keep the function code as flat as possible, minimizin indented logic where possible 
- when using try catch blocks, keep on single lines where possible. example:
    - try   { somevar = await some_promise(); }
    - catch { rej(); return; }
